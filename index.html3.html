<p>My dog's name is Poodle (strange, I know) and he is a large standard Poodle. He was originally named Wally, but he only listened if we called him "Poodle"! He is always very hyper and loves to go on walks, he runs away for about 4 hours a day... we are still unsure of where he goes and what he is doing, but he always returns for dinner. </p>

<p> A few fun facts about Poodle...</p>
